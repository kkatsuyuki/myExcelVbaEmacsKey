* myExcelVbaEmacsKey
  My configuration of Excel vba to use Emacs key bindings

** Features
   - Emacs-like selection moving (forward: =C-f=, backward: =C-b=, next: =C-n=, previous: =C-p=)
   - Move end/start in the active row (end: =C-e=, start: =C-a=)
   - Kill/Insert row (kill: =C-k= insert: =C-i=)
   - Kept windows common keybindings (Copy: =C-c=, Paste: =C-v=)
   - Scroll up/down (up: =C-u=, down: =C-d=)
   - Other powerful functions
     + =SheetForward= / =SheetPrevious= : Select the next/previous sheet 
     + =CreateSheet= : Create the new sheet named by your input
     + =MoveRow= / =MoveCol= : Move the selection toward the row/column direction by inputted number/alphabet
   - Refered to EmacsMode.bas in [[https://gist.github.com/nozma/2603524#file-emacsmode-bas][this]]      

** Requirements
   - Excel

   I saw this program work on Excel 2007 and Windows7.

** Install
*** Use only on the specified book
    Import the module file (=myEmacsKey.bas=) as the standard module and execute the procedure =MyEmacsMode=.
    1. Open the Excel book.
    2. Click Developer>"Visual Basic" on Ribbon (or Alt + F11).

       → VBE (Visual Basic Editor) is opened
    3. Select the desired project in Project explorer and File>"Import File..." on menu bar (or right click on the desired project and click "Import File...")
    4. Select the module file (=myEmacsKey.bas=) and import.
       
       → The new module is created under the module hierarchy on "Project explorer"
    5. Return to the Excel book window and click Developer>macro on Ribbon and execute =MyEmacsMode=.

*** Use globally
    Create Personal.xlsb (which is always opened internally ,whatever book is opened) and 
    import the module file (=myEmacsKey.bas=) on it.
    Additionaly you have to register the procedure =MyEmacsMode= so that 
    it can be read every time the book is opened.
    1. Create Personal.xlsb seeing [[https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Copy-your-macros-to-a-Personal-Macro-Workbook-aa439b90-f836-4381-97f0-6e4c3f5ee566][Copy your macros to a Personal Macro Workbook]].
       You may delete the macro you made to create this file.
    2. Open VBE and import above module files.
    3. The following codes are put into =ThisWorkbook= under the 
       project of =PERSONAL.xlsb=. The procedure =MyEmacsMode= is read 
       every time Excel is opened.
       
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Private Sub Workbook_Open() 
      Call MyEmacsMode          
    End Sub                     
    #+END_EXAMPLE

** Modify
   Since the configuration meets only my needs, 
   I encourage you to modify some configurations especially about key bindings.
   Modifying is enabled only by modifying imported module directly on VBE or by 
   importing the module file (=myEmacsKey.bas=) you edited.

** Future works (I want your ideas to solve them)
   - Move the window of InputBox where it does not prevent viewing
   - Use the other input method not to create the window instead of using InputBox
   - I want to assign ~C-M-...~ commands to ~M-...~ keys, but many ~M-...~ keys were shadowed by 
     the default access keys. I want to make them disable.
   - Translate ~C-m~ into ~Enter~ like Emacs
   - Create the =undo= procedure
